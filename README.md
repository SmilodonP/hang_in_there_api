# Hang in There API  

### Abstract:
[/x/]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
Here we have developed the back end API for the wonderful front end application we created in our previous project. Our API will allow the application to store its information in databases instead of the hard coded collections we were given for that project. Having the data stored in a database will make it significantly easier to have full CRUD control from both user and programmer perspectives.

### Installation Instructions:
[/x/]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
To access this application, please clone down a copy from this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/SmilodonP/hanging-in-there). Once that is complete, from your terminal, cd into the project file and enter "code ." into your terminal. This will open the project in your VSCode. From here navigate to the correct local repository in your terminal and enter 'Rails S'. Then you can open your Postman application and connect to the liveserver. This should allow you to interact with the database to your heart's content.
### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
This was our second project in the second module of The Turing School of Software & Design's fullstack software engineering program, and the first Rails API project that we have been assigned. We were given 5 days to complete the project.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
This was a green field project that tested and grew our ability to create a Rails API from skratch, not only establishing but expanding its functionality as well. We worked with Ruby on Rails and Postman.
### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
We are very proud to have completed the requirements and started wading into the extensions. We experienced very few challenges that felt like more than a little bump in the road.
